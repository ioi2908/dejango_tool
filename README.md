# dejango_tool
This is a python script that helps Django beginners to deploy easily on Heroku

## Contribute (for Developer)
To contribe on the project, fork or clone the project, then activate the virtual environment
by run `python3 -m venv venv` then navigate to the root directory of the project
`cd trial_project` 

Other files in the project(actually, django project) are meant to be as trial/sample files to check if the script works.You can check them or simply
start your localhost `python manage.py migrate` then `python manage.py runserver`.
The script file is `dejango.py`, follow along then contribute on the script.

## Use (for User)
The aim of the script is to get a tool out of it where a user can install and run it to deploy the project on Heroku.
Currently, running `python3 dejango.py` doesnt reach to its final result targeted.
